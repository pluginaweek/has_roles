== Description

One of the easiest and most straightforward techniques for adding role
management and authorization to specific parts of your application is
restricting usage on a controller/action-basis.  Each role defined in your
system is mapped to one or more permissions.  Each permission is a combination
of a controller and action.

== Usage

Note that this is a reference implementation and, most likely, should be
modified for your own usage.

=== Adding permissions

To add permissions, you can create an initializer like so:

config/initializers/permissions.rb:

  Permission.bootstrap(
    {:id => 1, :controller => 'application'},
    {:id => 2, :controller => 'admin/stats'},
    {:id => 3, :controller => 'comments', :action => 'create'},
    ...
  )

=== Adding / Updating roles

To add / update roles, you can create an initializer like so:

config/initializers/roles.rb:

  Role.bootstrap(
    {:id => 1, :name => 'admin'},
    {:id => 2, :name => 'developer'},
    ...
  )
  
  RolePermission.bootstrap(
    {:role => 'admin', :permission => 'application/'},
    {:role => 'admin', :permission => 'admin/states/'},
    {:role => 'developer', :permission => 'comments/create'},
    {:role => 'developer', :permission => 'admin/stats/'},
    ...
  )

=== Checking a user's authorization

Below is an example of checking a user's authorization for a url before
displaying information:

app/views/layouts/application.rhtml:

  <% if authorized_for?(:controller => 'admin/users') %>
  <p>Read to start administering your website?</p>
  <% end %>

== Testing

Before you can run any tests, the following gem must be installed:
* plugin_test_helper[http://github.com/pluginaweek/plugin_test_helper]

To run against a specific version of Rails:

  rake test RAILS_FRAMEWORK_ROOT=/path/to/rails

== Dependencies

* Rails 2.3 or later
* enumerate_by[http://github.com/pluginaweek/enumerate_by] 0.4.0 or later
